# LH WALLETS

This is a tool inspired by my own need to a simple way to store my crypto wallets, in a digital but secure manner.

It's a simple web application, designed to encrypt / decrypt crypto wallets information. There you can generate a encrypted file with all your wallets recovery seeds, protected by aes-256-cbc cypher and store it digitally and safe.

The whole proccess runs on your browser, locally, and no information is sent to internet. I've made this project as opensource 
so everyone can check it to ensure your data safety. 

Hope it can help some one.

PS.: Don't forget the password used to encrypt the file, there's no way to recover without it.
